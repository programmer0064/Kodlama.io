""" In object-oriented programming, everything is about objects and classes. From this point of view, data types are actually classes and variables are instances of these classes, so objects.
There are different kind of data types. There are multiple data types: """

#Numeric data
age = 5 #int - whole numbers
height = 180.5 #float - decimal numbers

#Sequence data
name = "Engin Demirog" #collection of more than one character
list = ["Python", "Java", "Java Script", 5] #like arrays but they can carry more than one data type and are flexible since you can easily replace the variables within the list
tuple = ("turkish", "english", 8) #only difference to a list is that tuples are not changeable


#Boolean
truth = True  #can only return True or False
lie = False

#Dictionary
translator = {"yemek" : "to eat", "yatmak" : "to sleep"}   #stores key : value pairs, whereas each pair is seperated by a comma
