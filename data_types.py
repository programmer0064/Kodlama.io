""" In object-oriented programming, everything is about objects and classes. From this point of view, data types are actually classes and variables are instances of these classes, so objects.
There are different kind of data types. There are multiple data types: """

#Sequence data

tuple = ("turkish", "english", 8) #only difference to a list is that tuples are not changeable


#Boolean
truth = True  #can only return True or False
lie = False

#Dictionary
